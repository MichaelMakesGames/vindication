A turn-based strategy game of urban unrest

Technical development of this project is on a hiatus while I figure out game design and pursue some of other projects.

The goal is to create an assymetric game for two players, where one player is the authorities and the other is the rebels in the Age of Revolutions. Both want to use the upheaval to cement their own power but must be careful not to let the situation spiral out of control.
